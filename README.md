Machine learning assignment, to build a model that predicts the trend of bikes rented in Seoul.

Conducted a study that predicts the number of public bikes rented in Seoul within an hour, using machine learning to determine an appropriate polynomial degree for a polynomial regression model.

This project used the 'Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set' from the UCI repository and explored concepts like k-fold cross-validation, train-test split validation, feature scaling, MSE, learning curves, regularization and normalization, and feature selection, resulting in a model that explains ~78.6% and 76.7% of the training and testing setsâ€™ variability respectively.
